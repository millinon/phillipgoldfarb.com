    <p>I'm a software developer currently located in Johnson City, Tennessee. I attended University of Tennesse for five years, majoring in Computer Science. You can read my resume <a href="https://jump.wtf/lPkI9y">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>

    <p>I am seeking employment at this time in a software development position that is relevant to my interests and experience. My long-term goal is to finish my degree, and teach computer science to the K-12 age group. No matter what I end up doing, it is very important to me that I am able to apply and extend my knowledge and skills.</p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>

    <h3>Languages:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>C / C++ / C#</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>PHP / HTML / CSS / JavaScript / SQL</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Web Technology:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Apache / Nginx / HHVM</li>
        <li>Dovecot / Postfix</li>
        <li>Amazon Web Services</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are many more languages, frameworks, and systems that I am fairly familiar with, but not very experienced with. It is accurate to say that I am good at learning, and I'd like to think that I'm good at teaching.</p>

    <h2>This Site</h2>

    <p>This site is made with Jekyll, and is hosted on my server that I run from home. I'm still working on it!<p>

        <h2>Bio:</h2>
        <p>
        I am twenty-four years old. I grew up in Baltimore, Maryland. I decided to go to the University of Tennessee for physics, before changing my major to computer science. I enjoy outdoors activities like hiking and kayaking. Before I settle, I would like to do some travel, perhaps in Europe.
