# Academia

I have studied at the University of Tennessee for five years, majoring in Physics for the first year and a half, and majoring in Computer Science for the remainder.

Following is a listing of the classes I have taken.

## CS102: Introduction to Computer Science

Basic C++, using the [Scribbler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribbler_(robot)) to develop basic programming ability.

## CS140: Data Structures I

Using C++'s STL and self-made structures to develop algorithms.

## CS160: Computer Architecture

Low-level analysis of computer architecture, and an introduction to ARM assembly programming.

## CS302: Data Structures II

A continuation of CS140, using more advanced algorithms to approach more complex problems.

## CS311: Discrete Mathematics

Sets, functions, relations, equivalence relations, partial orderings and proof techniques, especially mathematical induction. Application of proof techniques to prove correctness of algorithms. Introduction to basic counting and combinatorics.

## [CS312: Algorithm Analysis and Automata](/classes/cs312)

Fundamentals of regular, context-free, and recursively enumerable languages, as well as finite automata, pushdown automata, and Turing Machines, with discussions of counting and combinatorics as related to the analysis of algorithms.

## CS360: Systems Programming

Introduction to C and a UNIX enviornment, writing programs that utilize system calls.

## CS361: Operating Systems

An overview of how operating systems are written to provide safety and functionality.

## CS365: Computer Languages / Systems

Introduction to Java and Scheme, and an analysis of the different programming language paradigms.

## [CS420: Biologically Inspired Computing](/classes/cs420)

An overview of programming techniques that mimic patterns found in nature.

## [CS456: Computer Graphics](/classes/cs456)

An introduction to the history of graphics computing, and to the use of OpenGL and WebGL for rendering graphics.

## CS461: Compilers

An overview of the design of a compiler's frontend, backend, and optimizations.

## [CS462: Parallel Computing](/classes/cs462)

An overview of techniques used for parallel computing, involving OpenMP, MPI, and using BeagleBone Blacks and UTK's Newton HPC platform.

## ECE453: Computer Networks



## CS401 & CS402: Senior Design
